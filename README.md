# 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Bee – Engineering Leader & Senior Software Engineer

I'm Benson Imoh (Bee) — a software engineer and engineering leader with over a decade of experience building web platforms, automating workflows, leading distributed teams, and contributing to open-source projects. I currently serve as **Associate Director of Engineering at [350.org](https://350.org)**, where I combine leadership with hands-on software engineering and systems architecture to support its mission in addressing climate issues.

I specialize in building scalable systems, designing cloud-native infrastructure, and improving developer experience through automation and thoughtful architecture.
